Tests With Redirect Output

Single redirect output: Working
echo hey > file
Multiple redirect output: Working
echo hey > file > file 1
echo hey > file > file1 > file2

Double redirect output: Working
echo hey >> file
Multiple redirect output: Working
echo hey >> file >> file 1
echo hey >> file >> file1 >> file2

Both commands intercalate: Working
echo hey > file >> file2
echo hey >> file > file2

Known Bugs:

Wrong commands create files:
hey > file
hey >> file
Redirect without input terminates the program: 
> file
>> file

echo hey > file0
echo hey > file1 > file2
echo hey > file3 > file4 > file5
echo hey >> file6
echo hey >> file7 >> file8
echo hey >> file9 >> file10 >> file11
echo hey > file12 >> file13
echo hey >> file14 > file15
hey > file16
hey >> file17
> file18
>> file19
